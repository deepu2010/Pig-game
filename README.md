# Pig-game

Pig game is a traditional chinese game played using dices. Player who reaches the target score first, wins! 

I have given two dices to my players. The dice values will be dispalyed on the screen. 

# Rules:
1. Two players can play this game
2. The player who cross 100 first is the winner. 
3. Players can merge their current score with their total score by clicking on 'HOLD' button on the screen
4. If a player rolls a value of '1', the current score of the player will be reset and the player loses his turn.
5. To play again, players can tap on 'New game' button.

# Concepts Used:
1. ### Javascript ES6
2. ### HTML5
3. ### CSS3
4. ### Implemented Model-View-Controller(MVC) pattern for designing this architecture
5. ### Built this project based on MVC architecture.
